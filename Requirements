NMEA Parser
* From input stream parse for GPRMC messages.
* Extract UTC, LAT, LON from GPRMC messages.
* Create and dump to file extracted information in a decimal format

NMEA Parser tester
* create test data, 300 lines containing GPRMC, GPGGA, and GPGLL
* output stream each character of test data

Valid Test
1) pipe tester into parser. If parser generates a file with 100 lines of UTC, LAT, LON, and first/last 2 data points compare accuratly with test data, then test passed.
